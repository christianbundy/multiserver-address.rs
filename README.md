# Multiserver Address (Rust)

This is a Multiserver address parser written by Piet Geursen and shared with
[a GitHub snippet][0]. I'm playing around with the code because I'm interested
in sucking at Rust a bit less, but I need to stress **you should not depend on
my scratchpad for anything ever**.

## Install

Get [Cargo](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=rust+cargo&atb=v1-1&ia=software)
and run `cargo test`.
